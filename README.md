# Reproduction_of_wavelet_denoising_1
Reproduction of paper, all by my own with out professor advising, spend me a whole day. This is my first try in a journal, i guess i do my best, written this code in twice(first one got a bug but i can't find out, so i write a new one). The truth is, my code didn't work well. I could be wrong in some where....................................somebody help me pls(lol)
